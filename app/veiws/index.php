                        cable and chart recorders.<br></p>

                    <h2>Information about Temperature Sensors and Instrumentation:</h2>
                    <p>
                        Over the years we have seen many sensors being developed for measuring temperature. A common
                        piece of temperate instrumentation is a thermocouple, which is a device consisting of two
                        dissimilar conductors. Thermocouples are widely used as a type of temperature sensor for
                        measurement and control.<br><br>

                        Another popular measuring advice is a temperature data logger, which is a portable measurement
                        instrument. A data logger is capable of independently recording temperature over a defined
                        period of time. The data collected can then be viewed and evaluated after it has been recorded.
